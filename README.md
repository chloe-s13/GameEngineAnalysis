# GameEngineAnalysis
This is the archive of data I gathered during my Independent Study of Game Engines.
I have uploaded one large PDF containing all of my research information, and I have
also uploaded the separate sections into their own smaller PDF files.

This can also be viewed on my senior portfolio at: https://chloes313.wixsite.com/website

# Project Downloads
The projects I created are available on my mega drive at the links below.
I would upload them here but they're too big.
